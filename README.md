Tools to control and manage ethereum accounts

this includes tools from https://github.com/corpetty/py-etherscan-api (corpetty) and https://github.com/antonio-fr/Vanityreum (antonio-fr)

Note: after addr.txt file is generated it will still need to be cleaned up in order to work with get_balance_multi.py

Note: add your api key from etherscan.io to api.json as stated by corpetty.
  example:
    { 'key' : 'your_key' }
